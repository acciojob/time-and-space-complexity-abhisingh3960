    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity efficient</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input data. It is often expressed in Big O notation, such as O(n), which describes the upper bound of memory usage as the input size grows.</p>
